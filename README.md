## How it Works

- Once installed, the Productivity Booster extension will automatically block access to websites on the list. It works by intercepting requests to social media sites and redirecting them to a "blocked" page.

- Blocking Logic: The extension uses background scripts to check the URLs of any page you attempt to visit. If the site matches a blocked social media website, access is denied, and you’re redirected to a page indicating that the site is blocked.

- Managing Blocked Sites: You can manage the list of blocked sites directly through the extension’s settings popup.

# Usage

1.See Blocked Websites List: The popup also displays all the websites currently blocked.

2.Increases Productivity.
